# Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) Sixth Participants Committee Meeting

## Meeting Details
- **Date:** June 28, 2010 - July 1, 2010
- **Location:** Cayetano, Guyana
- **Resolution:** PC6/2010/9

## Fund Sources and Uses
The following is stated:

1. The PC has approved the target funding of $85 million for the preparation fund compared to the previously set goal of $185 million.
2. To ensure this reduction, the PC decided that only the 20 REDD participant countries could receive a maximum of $3.6 million per country in the preparation grant, with an additional $200,000 per country for R-PP grant writing. However, the PC decided not to provide grants or national implementation support to the last 12 REDD participant countries selected by the FCPF.
3. The PC decided that the first group of 20 REDD participant countries will have their $3.6 million preparation grants allocated until the PC's sixth meeting, after which all REDD participant countries should consider regional balance when allocating the grants.
4. The FMT provided an update on the sources of the current funding and its expected uses as of June 2010. It was noted that there is sufficient funding available for 37 REDD participant countries to provide R-PP grant writing. Additionally, it is anticipated that there will be enough funding to provide a preparation grant of up to $3.6 million to approximately 19 REDD participant countries. The FMT also noted that there is sufficient funding to provide additional preparation grants if the current funding is transferred.
