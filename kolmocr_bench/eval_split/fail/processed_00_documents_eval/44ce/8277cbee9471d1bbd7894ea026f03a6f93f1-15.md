## Interests
The high-skilled temporary worker program is unable to achieve its goals of ensuring that employers can hire the workers they need while also protecting native workers.

### Program Goals
The program is unable to ensure that employers can hire the workers they need and prioritize U.S. workers, leading to the exploitation of immigrant workers at the expense of native workers.

### Current Programs
The United States currently operates two main temporary worker programs: H-2A for agricultural workers and H-2B for non-agricultural workers. These programs fail to meet their core objectives of providing necessary workers to employers and protecting U.S. workers from exploitation.

#### H-2A Program
Established in 1986 and finalized in 1990, the H-2A program covers only a portion of the legal foreign worker needs, particularly in agricultural jobs. The program has been criticized for its limitations and lack of enforcement.

#### H-2B Program
The H-2B program was established in 1986 and finalized in 1990. It is designed to cover only a limited number of agricultural jobs, with additional coverage for seasonal or intermittent work and related projects. However, it provides only about 67,000 visas annually compared to approximately 760,000 legal foreign workers.

#### MPI Estimates
According to MPI estimates, between 2008 and 2012, about 140 million (18%) illegal immigrants were working in the agricultural sector, 130 million (16%) in construction, 110 million (13%) in professional services, 100 million (12%) in administrative and support services, and 100 million (12%) in educational services.

#### Additional Visa Categories
Other visa categories such as A, E-1, E-2, G, L-1, J-1, and P may be relevant. These programs provide less robust protections for workers and have been criticized for various conditions and issues.
