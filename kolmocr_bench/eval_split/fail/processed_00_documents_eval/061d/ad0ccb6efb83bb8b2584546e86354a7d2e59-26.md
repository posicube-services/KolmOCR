## Introduction
- **Nature Requirement:** The concept of "nature requirement" is evolving, reflecting the public's growing support for environmental protection and sustainable practices. This support has led to certain constraints being placed on the use of natural resources.

## Section A: Public Support for Environmental Protection
- **Public Sentiment:** There is increasing public sentiment in favor of environmental protection and sustainability, which has led to certain constraints being placed on the use of natural resources. This is due to the growing importance of sustainability and the effectiveness of public support in achieving these goals.

## Section B: Addressing the Challenges
### Subsection B.1: Expansion of the Legal Framework
- **Lowenstein's Proposal:** Lowenstein proposed that the expansion of the legal framework should be considered to address the challenges. He argued that the current system of judicial review is not sufficient to ensure that the interests of the environment are adequately protected. Therefore, it is necessary to expand the scope of judicial review to include more areas related to environmental protection.
  
### Subsection B.2: Internet-Based Solutions
- **Baer and Ulrich's Proposal:** Baer and Ulrich proposed that the internet can be used as a platform to address the challenges. They argued that the internet provides a platform for people to engage in discussions and debates about environmental issues, which can lead to better understanding and cooperation among stakeholders.

## Conclusion
- **Garrett's Proposal:** Garrett proposed that the internet can be used as a platform to address the challenges. He argued that the internet provides a platform for people to engage in discussions and debates about environmental issues, which can lead to better understanding and cooperation among stakeholders.
