# Diagram Description

The following is a description of the diagram provided:

## Figure 1

This figure illustrates the flow within a system labeled as "Service 100." The diagram includes several components and their interactions.

- **Cache (125)**: This component is shown at the top left of the figure.
- **Content Control Module (130)**: This module is connected to the Cache (125) and receives "Standard Internet AppData" (142).
- **Internet Site (136)**: This component is connected to the Content Control Module (130) and receives "Standard Internet AppData" (142) from it.
- **Internet Requests (141)**: These requests are directed towards the Internet Site (136).
- **Device-Generated AppData (143)**: This data is generated by the device and is shown in Fig. 2.
- **Wireless Overlay (101)**: This overlay connects to the Device-Generated AppData (143).

### Connections
- The Cache (125) provides data to the Content Control Module (130).
- The Content Control Module (130) processes data and provides "Standard Internet AppData" (142) to both the Internet Site (136) and the Device-Generated AppData (143).
- The Device-Generated AppData (143) is also connected to the Wireless Overlay (101).

## Figure 2

This figure shows the device-generated appdata being transmitted through the wireless overlay.

### Connections
- Device-Generated AppData (143) is connected to the Wireless Overlay (101).

### Image Bounding Box
- Figure 1: `bbox_2d[32, 57, 269, 480]`
- Figure 2: `bbox_2d[36, 497, 165, 631]`

This description should provide a clear understanding of the flow and connections within the system as depicted in the figures.
