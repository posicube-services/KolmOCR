# Council Motion

## C4 Trawl EM

### Date: 2022년 6월 11일

The council is empowered to issue the final resolution by adopting alternative 2: implementing electronic monitoring and alerts on board for vessels operating in the Gulf of Alaska that do not have the option to participate in the shared catch program with Trawl EM.

The council supports the Trawl EM committee's authority and provides additional information as follows:

- Use of a 1.65% partial coverage fee to cover the costs associated with Trawl EM options, excluding the participation fees for vessels without Trawl EM, services, and maintenance.
- Use of a 1.65% partial coverage fee to cover the costs associated with partial coverage monitoring of vessels operating in the Gulf of Alaska.
- If a vessel joins the Trawl EM program, it must comply with the Trawl EM program at all times, with the exception of a 25% non-compliance limit within a calendar year in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). All other vessels must be included in the monitoring program.
- To achieve specific goals without exceeding the maximum allowable catch and GOA trawl restrictions, we should adopt an effective strategy. The council will maintain its current position until October 2022.
