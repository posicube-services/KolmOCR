is greater than \( K_1 n(1-\alpha)|\log n(1-\alpha)| \), where \( K_1 \) is a constant independent of \( a \) and \( n \).

We now consider the Blaschke product
\[
B(z) = \prod \frac{a_k^{n_k} - z^{n_k}}{1 - a_k^{n_k} z^{n_k}}.
\]
The product converges if \( \sum n_k(1-a_k) < \infty \), in particular, if
\[
n_k(1-a_k) = 1/k(\log k)^{3/2} \quad (k = 2, 3, \cdots ).
\]
If moreover the sequence \( \{n_k\} \) increases fast enough, we obtain disjoint intervals \( r_k < r < a_k \) such that
\[
\int_{r_k}^{a_k} \int_0^{2\pi} |B'(re^{i\theta})| r d\theta dr > K_2 n_k(1-a_k)|\log n_k(1-a_k)|
\]
\[
> K_2/k(\log k)^{1/2},
\]
and Mergeljian's theorem is proved.

From our construction, we see immediately that \textit{there exists a continuous function \( f \) satisfying condition (1)}. Indeed, it is sufficient to choose finite Blaschke products \( B_m \) such that, for each of certain disjoint concentric annuli \( A_m \),
\[
\iint_{A_m} |B'_m| dS - \sum_{j \neq m} \iint_{A_j} |B'_j| dS > m^3,
\]
and to take \( f(z) = \sum m^{-2} B_m(z) \).

Our second example is based on the function
\[
g(z) = \exp \left( -a \frac{1+z^n}{1-z^n} \right).
\]
Since the maximum and minimum modulus of \( g(z) \) on the circle \( |z^n| = \rho \) are
\[
\exp \left( -a \frac{1-\rho}{1+\rho} \right) \quad \text{and} \quad \exp \left( -a \frac{1+\rho}{1-\rho} \right),
\]
the function \( g \) maps the circle \( C_r \) onto a curve of length greater than
\[
2n \left\{ \exp \left( -a \frac{1-r^n}{1+r^n} \right) - \exp \left( -a \frac{1+r^n}{1-r^n} \right) \right\}.
\]
To estimate the integral of this lower bound over the interval \( 0 < r < 1 \),
