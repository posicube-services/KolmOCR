BOUNDED FUNCTIONS WITH LARGE CIRCULAR VARIATION

GEORGE PIRANIAN

In 1951, S. N. Mergeljan [1] proved that there exists a bounded holomorphic function f for which

\[
\iint_{|z|<1} |f'(z)| \, dS = \infty.
\]

An obvious geometric interpretation of (1) is that the length l(r) of the image of the circle \(|z| = r\) grows so rapidly, as \(r \to 1\), that \(l(r)\) is not an integrable function of \(r\).

An alternate geometric interpretation of (1) is that the length \(V(f, \theta)\) of the image of the radius of \(e^{i\theta}\) is not an integrable function of \(\theta\). W. Rudin [2, Theorem III] has proved a proposition stronger than Mergeljan's, namely, that there exist Blaschke products \(B(z)\) such that \(V(B, \theta) = \infty\) for almost all \(\theta\). It follows that there exists a function \(f\), holomorphic in the unit disk \(D\) and continuous in the closure of \(D\), such that \(V(f, \theta) = \infty\) for almost all \(\theta\) [2, Theorem IV].

Both Mergeljan's and Rudin's arguments involve nonconstructive steps, and therefore they do not allow us to visualize the functions \(f\) in terms of any of the customary representations. In this note, I give two explicit constructions that prove Mergeljan's result. Unfortunately, my examples are inadequate for Rudin's theorem.

We begin with the function \((a^n - z^n)/(1 - a^n z^n)\), where \(2^{-1/n} < a < 1\). We write \(a^n = \alpha\) and \(z^n = \xi\), and we observe that for \(0 < \rho < \alpha\), the maximum and minimum values of \(|(\alpha - \xi)/(1 - \alpha \xi)|\) on the circle \(|\xi| = \rho\) are

\[
(\alpha + \rho)/(1 + \alpha \rho) \quad \text{and} \quad (\alpha - \rho)/(1 - \alpha \rho),
\]

respectively. The difference between the two moduli is \(2\rho(1 - \alpha^2)/(1 - \alpha^2 \rho^2)\). Therefore the function \((a^n - z^n)/(1 - a^n z^n)\), whose \(2n\) points of maximum and minimum modulus on the circle \(|z| = r\) separate each other, maps that circle onto a curve of length greater than

\[
2n \cdot 2r^n (1 - a^{2n})/(1 - a^{2n} r^{2n}) \qquad (0 < r < a).
\]

The integral of this quantity, taken over the interval \(3^{-1/n} < r < a\),
