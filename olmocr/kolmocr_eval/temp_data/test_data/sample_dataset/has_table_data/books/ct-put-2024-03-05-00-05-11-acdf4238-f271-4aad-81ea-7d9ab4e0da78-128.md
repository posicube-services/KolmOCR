pared in total with their prototypes, hence the final test embraces but few figures and the chance of "assenting" to an error is greatly lessened; while the relation of the figures is altered into new combinations.

316. A check-ledger or balance-ledger is in effect a duplicate ledger kept in some simpler and briefer, perhaps rougher way, because it is not needed for precise information but for the purpose of a check on the ordinary ledger. For this reason, it may be kept in pencil; dates may be omitted and all descriptive matter; a large number of accounts may appear at one opening; or it may carry balances only and not transactions. This may be a very good plan in a mercantile business where balances are not very often called for except monthly. It serves mainly as a corrective of the monthly trial balance, all final balances being compared before totaling.

317. In a banking business of any kind, the correct keeping of depositors' accounts is a matter of the greatest importance. The balance should be at all times ascertainable and reliable to avoid the risk of overpayment. The balance-ledger was therefore introduced as a check on the ordinary ledger. Its peculiarity is that each account runs horizontally, occupying a line across the page. The first column in the page contains the initial balances, usually in red, of thirty or forty accounts, a name on each line. When totaled and aggregated this column is a trial-balance of the deposit system. The next column contains all the credits for the day on each account, a third column all the debits, and the fourth the resulting balances of the next day. It is evident that the totals may be proved, forming the equation:

\[
\text{Old Balance} + \text{Credits} - \text{Debits} = \text{New Balance}
\]
