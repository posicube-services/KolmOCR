The number of Sertoli and interstitial cells in all the experimental groups did not show a significant difference compared to the control group (Table 2).

According to Duncan test the means available in the each row (Mean±SEM), which at least have one letter in common, do not have significant difference with each other at level of 5% of Duncan test. This is the test.

DISCUSSION

Hypothalamic gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) by influencing on the anterior pituitary gland increases the secretion of FSH and LH and thus stimulates the secretion of testosterone. Based on the results obtained in this study, simultaneous increase in serum levels of testosterone and LH, FSH and GnRH indicated the influence of silymarin on hypothalamus-pituitary-testis axis. Hypothalamus-pituitary-testis axis is affected by positive and negative control factors. Norepinephrine is one of the factors influencing the axis [15, 16]. It has been shown that silymarin have increased the concentration of norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine in certain areas of the brain of laboratory white mice [17]. It seems in the current study that increase of gonadotropin hormones from pituitary gland is related to increased release of norepinephrine by silymarin. Norepinephrine by increasing the synthesis of
